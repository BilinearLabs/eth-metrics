## Introduction

This tool monitors Ethereum consensus stakingâ€“pool performance. Given a set of labeled validators, it calculates:

* Rates of faulty head, source, and target votes (per the GASPER algorithm)
* Changes in rewards and penalties between consecutive epochs
* Proposed and missed blocks for each epoch

It leverages the beacon state, which makes it resource-intensive when tracking only a few validators but scales efficiently to monitor hundreds of thousands. All data is persisted in a SQLite database.

By default, metrics are computed from the latest head as the chain progresses in real time. You can backfill historical epochs using `--backfill-epochs` but note that this requires access to an archival node.

## Requirements

This project requires:
* An ethereum `consensus` client compliant with the http api running with `--enable-debug-rpc-endpoints`.
* An ethereum `execution` client compliant with the http api.

## Build

### Docker

Use the public docker image.

```console
docker pull bilinearlabs/eth-metrics:latest
```

Build with docker:

```console
git clone https://github.com/bilinearlabs/eth-metrics.git
docker build -t eth-metrics .
```

### Source

```console
git clone https://github.com/bilinearlabs/eth-metrics.git
go build
```

## Usage

The following flags are available:

```console
./eth-metrics --help
```

Place in `pool_a.txt` file the validators keys you want to track.

```

```

And in `pool_b.txt` other ones.
```

```

You can pass as many `--pool-name` as you want. The name of the pool will be taken from the file.
This example will monitor the performance of `pool_a` and `pool_b` and store in a SQLite database their performance, using said names as labels.

```console
./eth-metrics \
--eth1address=https://your-execution-endpoint \
--eth2address=https://your-consensus-endpoint \
--verbosity=debug \
--database-path=db.db \
--pool-name=pool_a.txt \
--pool-name=pool_b.txt \
```

You can access the content of the database directly, or by using the API that allows to pass raw queries. For example, you can get the metrics from the latest epoch for `pool_a` as follows.

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/query \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{\"sql\": \"SELECT * \
FROM t_pools_metrics_summary \
WHERE f_epoch = (SELECT MAX(f_epoch) FROM t_pools_metrics_summary) \
  AND f_pool = 'pool_a';\"}"
```
