# pools

In `pools/pools.go` you can find the public addresses that were used to make the deposit of 32 Eth to the Ethereum 2.0 smart contract for different well known staking pools and exchanges. These addresses are used to filter out the validators that belong to each pool. Feel free to open a PR with new addresses if you want to get your pool monitored.
